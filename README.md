# 📊 HR Survey Analysis Project

> **Data-driven insights for HR leadership — understanding employee sentiment through survey analytics.**

---

## 🧩 Overview

This project analyzes employee survey responses to identify trends, pain points, and opportunities for improving workplace satisfaction.  
The analysis was performed on survey data from approximately **1,500 employees** across **Washington state**, provided by **Maven Analytics**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

### 🧹 **Objective 1 — Data Exploration & Profiling**
Ensure data quality and consistency before visualization.

**Key tasks:**
- Calculate profiling metrics (min, max, count, blanks)  
- Remove blank and duplicate records  
- Standardize inconsistent text entries  
- Analyze response frequencies by **Department** and **Question**

---

### ⚙️ **Objective 2 — Data Preparation for Visualization**
Structure clean and aggregated data for effective visualization.

**Key tasks:**
- Create a new sheet: `Chart Source`  
- Generate a unique list of survey questions  
- Compute counts and averages for each response (scale 1–4)  
- Convert counts into **percentages**  
- Sort questions by descending average response  

---

### 📈 **Objective 3 — Visualization & Insights**
Create clear and insightful data visualizations for decision-making.

**Visualization approach:**
- Build **100% stacked bar charts** (Likert scale style)  
- Apply intuitive color mapping:  
  🔴 **Red/Orange** → Negative responses (1–2)  
  🔵 **Blue tones** → Positive responses (3–4)  
- Add data labels, remove gridlines for clarity  
- Align bars symmetrically (positives right, negatives left)
